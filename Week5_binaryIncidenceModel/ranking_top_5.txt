/Query 92: the phenomenon of radiation caused by charged particles moving in varying electric and magnetic fields

Document 4978: radiation emitted by a uniformly moving electron in electron plasma in a magnetic field  results of the theoretical considerations presented indicate that cerenkov type radiation may be produced by charged particles not necessarily moving at relativistic speeds cosmic particles in the ionosphere  the frequencies of the radiated ordinary waves lie in the range where is the plasma angular frequency that of extraordinary waves in the range where is the gyrofrequency  extraordinary waves only are produced in weak magnetic fields and by relativistic electrons

Document 9707: wide band amplifiers for bandwidths up to  an account is given of amplifiers of the type using low pass filters as interstage couplings these are superior to distributed amplifiers up to a certain frequency the value of which is about when valves are used and with valves a practical limit for the number of reactances in the coupling circuit is about five further increase would call for too narrow tolerances on the components and would greatly increase alignment difficulties theoretical computations of the coupling circuit could not be made accurately because of frequency variation of the components  a high accuracy frequency sweep generator is essential for the experimental investigations

Document 5049: amplitude limitation in oscillators  an oscillator which includes two biased diodes in the grid circuit to limit oscillation amplitude is analysed  amplitude of oscillation and harmonic distortion are calculated and represented by curves  from these curves it is observed that oscillations can be modulated linearly no frequency modulation occurs during amplitude modulation and harmonic distortion is very low  also the circuit is found to be adequate for high frequency stability  the distinctive feature of the circuit is shown to be that the static conditions of the valve such as bias voltage and direct anode current are independent of the oscillation amplitude a practical circuit is described
